h2. Tactics

The goblin hexer uses _lead from the rear_ to turn nearby allies into meat shields while it casts _vexing cloud_ around itself and its closets allies and enemies.  It then targets an enemy defender with _stinging hex_ and uses it _blinding hex_ on foes making ranged attacks.  When another goblin within 10 squares users _goblin tactics_, the goblin hexer uses _incite bravery_ to allow that goblin to make a free attack.
